Machine-Learning
=================

My works in Machine Learning starting on November 2014.

Started with Coursera work on Machine Learning dictated by Andrew Ng. It includes the following topics.

-Linear Regression
 -by Gradient Descent
 -by Normal Equation
-Logistic Regression
 -By Gradient Descent
 -By Normal Equation
 -Optimized Algorithms
-Quick intro to OCTAVE
-Neural Networks.


Most of the work will be carried using OCTAVE or MatLab.
